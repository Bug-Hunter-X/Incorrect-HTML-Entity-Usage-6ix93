# Incorrect HTML Entity Usage

This repository demonstrates a common error in HTML: the misuse of HTML entities `&lt;` and `&gt;`.  The example shows how incorrectly using these entities prevents the browser from parsing HTML tags correctly. The solution provides the proper way to represent these characters when needed in text content.

## Bug

The bug involves using `&lt;` and `&gt;` within an HTML tag incorrectly.  This will cause the browser to treat it as literal text, rather than an HTML element. 

## Solution

The solution correctly uses `&lt;` and `&gt;` to represent `<` and `>` within text content when these characters are needed. The solution also demonstrates the correct usage of `<div>` tags.
